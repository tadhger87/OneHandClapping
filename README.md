# OneHandClapping
# in progress

OneHandClapping is a fun Android audio manipulation app for social occasions.
At the opening night of an art exibition, gala reception or other social event, a speech is given to launch the event.  
You try to applaud at its conclusion, but find your hands occupied - perhaps by the glass of wine and/or exhibition booklet you're carrying.
With OneHandClapping you can choose from a range pre-loaded clapping tones, or record and save your own applause tone 
ahead of time.  Then just navigate to that clap on your phone using the OneHandClapping app, play, crank up the 
volume and never be caught short again!
